# Aquifree

This is the framework for a water style, tile based, puzzle game. The original intention of this project was to donate any ad revenue generated by the app to Clean watrer projects.

It is written using libgdx, a cross platform graphics/game library.

Due to time constraints, this project was put on hold. I plan on revisiting it in the future.
